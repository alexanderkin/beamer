% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution:

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Biodiversity
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Abundance: number of birds
      \item Species richness: number of bird species
      \item Species evenness: the level of how close in numbers each species in a community is
    \end{itemize}
  \item
   A source of lost economic and ecological opportunity
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Hunting and recreational value (Nocera and Koslowsky,2017)

\begin{frame}{WHY WORRY ABOUT CLIMATE AND BIRD BIODIVERSITY}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item There are many reasons why climatic factors might influence birds
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reduce reproductive and hatching success (Both and Visser, 2001; Miller-Rushing et al., 2008; Popoly et al., 2013)
      \item Advance the food peak (availability of insects) (McKechnie and Wolf, 2010; Welbergen e al., 2008)
    \end{itemize}
    \item The current climate is highly variable, but forecast now provide planning and risk-management opportunities for conservation policy.
    \item The global climate is changing, will bird biodiversity adjust/adapt in response?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RESERACH QUESTION}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What is the quantitative evidence for a general linkage between climate and bird biodiversity
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Heterogeneity across bird metrics, species and regions
      \item Short-run and Long-run effect
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{HYPOTHESIS}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Hypothesis 1:}The abundance, species richness, and evenness of generalist birds will increase with additional high-tempearture days, while those of specialist birds will decrease with additional high-temperature days.
    \item \alert{Hypothesis 2:}Bird metrics (abundance, species richness, and species evenness) in the drier regions will respond more negatively to increase in the high-temperature days.
    \item \alert{Hypothesis 3:}The potential negative impact of an increase in the high-temperature days on bird abundance, species richness, and evenness will be mitigated in the long-run.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{OBJECTIVE??}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    To examine the effects of climate change on whole bird population and two subgroups of bird species (specialist, generalist) by using three different metrics of birds: the number of birds, number of bird species and Shannon-weaver index on U.S. continent from 1981 to 2015.
    \item
    To provide large-scale empirical evidence on whether and to what extent the impact of climate change will be offset in the long-term due to the adaptation and evolution of bird population.

\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}

  % Keep the summary *very short*.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
  Overall, for the whole bird group, our results showed climate change had a significant impact on biodiversity of bird species in routes that were distributed across the United States.
  \item
    Swapping a day in the 0-15 °C range for one above 25 °C increases the decline of bird abundance, species richness and evenness by approximately 0.2%~0.5%.
  \item
  The impact of additional extreme heat temperature days (>25 C degree) on specialist birds is almost three times larger than the generalist birds.
  \item
  Compared to the eastern region, an additional day in the above 25 C range in the western and northern region will have a larger negative impact on the bird abundance(-1.5\%), species richness(-0.6\%) and Shannon-weaver index(-0.6\%).
  \item The long-run adaptation has offset only 20\% of the negative short-term impact of extreme heat(>25 °C) on bird species richness. Birds has no more adaptation to extreme heat in the long run.
